## Analogy

The analogy is quite simple. 

Over the course of getting to know Linux and during my career as a student, I had to reinstall my OS so many times, either because I bricked my previous install, or because things weren't working the way I wanted them to. On a particular day, I had installed Arch over ten times, which is my personal record of most-installed-computers-in-one-day so far but I also managed to speedrun the installation process to 8min30sec for the kernel with an additional 4min30sec for installing Sway. 

Discovering Linux was a tedious process and I had to start over several times, hence the analogy with [Sisyphus, greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus). 

*But also because it sounds cool and it has the sys from sytem in the name, don't tell anyone this though.*
